A tool that minimizes deterministic finite automata with a visual interactive graph.

start drawing and minimizing DFAs!

# How To Use
The `new label` text input is for naming the states/nodes and edges/transitions

**Adding States**

Type in `new label` input the name of the state e.g: `S1` then **hold** `Ctrl/cmd` and **double click** anywhere on the canvas to add that state.


**Adding Edges**

Type in `new label` input the name of the input e.g: `1`, **hold** `Ctrl/cmd`, **double click** on the source state, then **double click** on the target state.


**Making a State Final**

**Hold** `Alt` key and **double click** the state that you want to make final

**Deleting a State**

**Hold** `Ctrl/cmd` key and **right click** the state that you want to delete
